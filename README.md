The comparator of fun and various units

You can read about an idea and how it works on [my website](https://tkaczyk.me/compario.html "my website")

## API
Compario will be able to share data from its database using RESTful principles.
**This endpoints are not avaible in network yet.**

For example:

| Endpoint Address | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `compario.pl/api/values/speed`     | Will return list of all speed values       |
| `compario.pl/api/values/speed?value=489`  | Will return speed value with value 489    |

The rest of endpoints works the same way.
